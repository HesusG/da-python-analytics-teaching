## :wave: Welcome

This repository is intended for teaching analytics and includes a collection of Jupyter notebooks as homework assignments for various sessions. The notebooks cover a range of topics related to statistical inference, data modeling and probability distributions.

## ðŸ’» Description

The first notebook, Tarea_semana_1_Inferencia_estadistica.ipynb, focuses on statistical inference, which is the process of using data to make inferences about a population.

The second notebook, Tarea_semana_2_modelado_datos_discretos.ipynb, focuses on modeling data that is discrete in nature, that is, data that can only take on a limited set of values.

The third notebook, Tarea_semana_3_modelado_datos_continuos.ipynb, covers modeling data that is continuous in nature, which can take on any value within a range.

The fourth notebook, Tarea_semana_4_inferencia_estadistica.ipynb, covers further inferences statistical inferences.

The last two notebooks, continuous_distributions.ipynb, and discrete_distributions.ipynb, respectively, covers the probability distributions of continuous and discrete data.

In summary, this repository provides a comprehensive introduction to statistical inference and data modeling, including both discrete and continuous data, with a focus on understanding and applying probability distributions.
